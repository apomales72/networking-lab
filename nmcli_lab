ðŸ–§ Lab Overview

Weâ€™ll create two virtual machines (or containers/VMs if you like) running RHEL.

VM1 â†’ Will have a static IP.

VM2 â†’ Will use DHCP.
Weâ€™ll then verify connectivity with ping.

Step 1. Check existing connections

nmcli connection show

This lists existing network connections (e.g., Wired connection 1).

Step 2. Configure static IP on VM1

# Replace "Wired connection 1" with your actual connection name
nmcli con mod "Wired connection 1" ipv4.addresses 192.168.50.10/24
nmcli con mod "Wired connection 1" ipv4.gateway 192.168.50.1
nmcli con mod "Wired connection 1" ipv4.dns 8.8.8.8
nmcli con mod "Wired connection 1" ipv4.method manual
nmcli con up "Wired connection 1"

Verify:

ip addr show

ping -c3 192.168.50.1   # Test gateway

Step 3. Configure DHCP on VM2

nmcli con mod "Wired connection 1" ipv4.method auto
nmcli con up "Wired connection 1"

Verify:

ip addr show

Step 4. Test connectivity between VMs

On VM1:

ping -c3 192.168.50.20   # Replace with VM2â€™s IP from DHCP

On VM2:

ping -c3 192.168.50.10


âœ… At this point, youâ€™ve got a working lab: one static IP host and one DHCP host communicating.
